I made this project just for fun, it allows you to watch your favorite content in a highly responsive, detail-oriented app design to have a top-class listening experience.

It includes:
- Dark theme designðŸ˜Ž
- Main Page which lists all of your audio files in one placeðŸ”Ž
- Effects while changing song and an active Seek bar for an interactive experienceðŸŽ§

# ðŸŽµ Here are some snapshots of the design of the website!

##### Software Tool Used: Android Studio (Coded in Java for Mobile App Development)

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me for any queries or for the full code (Inspired from a Tutorial video from YouTube). 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I made this during my 3rd year of my Engineering degree as part of my Mini Project. I didn't take up Mobile App Development as my elective but had a keen interest to try to develop apps. I also have a hobby in Graphic design which I've also implemented in this project!
